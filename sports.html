    <h1>Women in Sports</h1>
    <h3> The Gender Gap in Numbers</h3> 
    <p> By age 14, girls tend to quit sports at twice the rate that boys do due to underfunding, social stigma, and lack of access. This problem also affects women´s health from a really young age. </p>
    <p>For decades, many scientists wrongly assumed that men´s and women´s bodies functioned the same, hindering female athletic perfomance. </p>
    <p>Female athletes account for 40% of sports participation, yet receive a mere 4% of total coverage, having a huge disadvantage when it comes to exposure</p>

    <h3> Initiatives and companies started by women.</h3>
    <p>Elite athlete Allyson Felix rewrite the rules of sponsorship by turning away from industry giants like Nike toward smaller brands like Athleta. Felix also launched a $200K grant with Athleta to help female Olympians cover childcare costs.</p>
    <p>Athletes like Alex Morgan, Simone Manuel, Sue Bird and Chloe Kim launched a platform named TOGETHXR, working to uplift the next generation of women in sports.</p>
    <p>Oiselle is a company created by women for women. Oiselle is a women athletic apparel company which sells running apparel for female athletes. By using the power of sports, Oiselle has the goal to build a sisterhood and support different movements like racial justice, land acknowledgment and environmental awarness. </p>
