    <h1>Women In Business</h1>

    <h3> The Gender Gap in Numbers</h3> 
    <p> The trend towards women in leadership positions seems to be on the rise. In fact, there are more women running Fortune 500 businesses today than at any point in the 63-year history of the Fortune 500. However, when put in context, that’s still only 6.4% of these leading companies.</p>
    <p>Overall, men receive an average loan size of $43,916 while women receive an average loan size of $38,942 – almost $5,000 less.</p>
    <p>Women receive just 7% of venture funds for their startups.</p>

    <h3> Great stuff happening right now</h3>
    <p>Women have a 69.5% success rate of crowdfunding for their businesses while men have a 61.4% success rate.</p>
    <p>Latina women-owned businesses grew more than 87%.</p>
    <p>64% of new women-owned businesses were started by women of color last year. </p>
