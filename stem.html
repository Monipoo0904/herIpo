    <p>In 2016, women earned only 19% of computer science degrees at the bachelor level, compared to 27% in 1997 </p>
    <p>A report from TrustRadius found that 72% of women in tech report being outnumbered by men in business meetings by a ratio of at least 2:1, while 26% report being outnumbered by 5:1 or more, showing the lack of representation for women in tech. </p>

On the opposite end, the average salary for women who report being dissatisfied with their compensation is $69,543, compared to $81,820 for men.</p>
